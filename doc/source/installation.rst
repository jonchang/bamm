Installation
============

This page needs a lot of work::
	
	** Not really done**

1. Download the latest version of BAMM.

2. This file is compressed. To uncompress it, run the following command
   from the directory in which BAMM was downloaded::

       tar -xzf bamm-1.0.tar.gz

3. This will create the directory bamm-1.0.
   Go into this directory and compile the program as follows::

       cd bamm-1.0
       make

4. This will create the directory build. 
   Within the build directory is an executable::

       bamm
